Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       284 out of   4,556    6%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        2,059
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           903 out of   2,059   43%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 669 out of   2,059   32%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         487 out of   2,059   23%
    Number of unique control sets:              40
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              65 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
